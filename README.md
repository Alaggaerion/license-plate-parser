## About this Parser

A little while ago by friend contacting and said He was involved in a hit and run. But even though the driver got away, my friend was able to grab a couple of licence plate numbers before the driver got away. On top of that he was able see determine the Make, Model and Year of the car. So asked if he gave a generated kist of licence plate numbers, if I could created an automation task to help him figure out what kind of cars the generated licence plate would return. So I created this Licence Plate Parser.

## How does it work

After downloading the repo on to you desktop, open you terminal and change directory into the folder once there: 

* Open `plates.csv` file.

Inside the file paste all the licence plate numbers you want to parse through.

Next inside terminal run the following command:

* `ruby plate_parser.rb`

Once the script fininshes running and new file will be created:

* `output.csv`
